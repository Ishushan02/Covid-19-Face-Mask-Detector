# Covid-19-Face-Mask-Detector
THe basic goal of this project is to detect whether a person is wearing a Face mask of not. The basic principle behid the code is that primarily we detect the face of a person and the the coordniates of its nose. If we are able to detect the coordinates of Nose which means that either the person is not wearing Face mask or the person is Face Mask improperly and if we are not able to detect the corrdinates of a Nose which seems to be the Nose is covered hence the person has worn Face mask.
